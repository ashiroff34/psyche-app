            <p className="mt-3 text-lg opacity-90">
              The {typeName} pattern often takes shape in childhoods where
              taking up space wasn&apos;t welcome. Understanding that origin
              is the first step in returning to a presence the Nine had to set
              down before they could remember setting it.

          <p className="mt-4 text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
            The Type 9 pattern tends to develop in childhood environments where
            the child experienced that their presence &mdash; their particular
            self, their needs, their desires &mdash; was less important than
            the peace and harmony of the family system. This did not require
            explicit suppression; it often emerged more subtly, as the child
            discovered that the easiest path was to accommodate, go along, and
            not take up too much space.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
            The Nine child often became the one who kept the peace &mdash;
            whose own emotional life was quieter than everyone else&apos;s
            because keeping it quiet was easier than navigating the
            consequences of being fully present. The loss, which was gradual
            and often invisible even to the Nine, was the loss of contact
            with their own priority, desire, and drive.
